//// UPDATE January 15th, 2014

We had to change the name of the theme to PoratlWP *not Portal. Portal is a free theme from wordpress.org and some bugs related to the Wordpress theme automatic updates were caused by the same name. When you update your theme, you will probably lose the Theme Options settings, but please activate it once again in Appearance>Themes and set your options once again. If you want your already setup options back and don't know how to achieve this in the WP database (wp_options>portal_options is now wp_options>portalWP_option) please contact us @ support.shindiristudio.com or via email @ support@shindiristudio.com and we'll help you.
